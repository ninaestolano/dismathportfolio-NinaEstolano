  <tr>
    <td>¬</td>
    <td>Negation</td> 
    <td>It has the opposite truth value of the propositional variable.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>˄</td>
    <td>Conjunction</td> 
    <td>It is only true if both propositions are true, false if otherwise.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>˅</td>
    <td>Disjunction</td> 
    <td>It is false if both propositions are false, true if otherwise.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>⊕</td>
    <td>Exclusive OR (XOR)</td> 
    <td>It is false if both propositions have the same truth value, true if otherwise.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>→</td>
